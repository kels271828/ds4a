Caveats:
"1. 'Unreliable' appears for rates when there are fewer than 20 deaths in the numerator. This is because the figure does not meet"
"the NCHS standard of reliability or precision. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/lbd.html#Unreliable."
"2. 'Not Applicable' appears when OE gestation is not available for a certain year. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/lbd.html#NotApplicable."
"3. Infant deaths are weighted so numbers may not exactly add to totals due to rounding. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/lbd.html#WeightFactors-Totals."
"4. Note that there may be slight differences in the number of infant deaths when comparing the Linked Birth / Death Records to"
"the other vital statistics. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/lbd.html#Weight Factors."
"5. About excluded prenatal care data: <p> Prenatal care data are recoded to ""Excluded"" for those reporting areas that used the"
"1989 revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Birth, because their data for prenatal care are not comparable to the data"
"from the reporting areas using the 2003 revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Birth. Note that prior data years (data for"
"deaths ocurring in years 2003 - 2006) excluded prenatal care data from those reporting areas that had adopted the 2003 revision"
